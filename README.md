Everything is on the root project directory. There are three classes in main.cpp, Point, Rectangle, and Assignment1. The Point and Rectangle classes was implemented in accordance with the assignment prompt. The Assignment1 class drives all of implemented classes and follows the instructions on Canvas to show that it works.



This project is managed by Cmake but a Makefile in the project root directory is available for compilation on CSE Grid.
